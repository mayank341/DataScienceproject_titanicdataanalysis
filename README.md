# üõ≥Ô∏è Titanic Survival Prediction - Data Science Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`_titanic.ipynb`) for a classic machine learning and data science project based on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to predict passenger survival using various machine learning techniques.

## üìÅ Project Structure

## üìä Dataset Information

The dataset used is from [Kaggle‚Äôs Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). It includes details about the passengers such as:

- PassengerId
- Survived (Target variable)
- Pclass (Ticket class)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (Siblings/Spouses aboard)
- Parch (Parents/Children aboard)
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked (Port of Embarkation)

## üß™ Project Workflow

The notebook covers the following steps:

1. **Importing Libraries**  
   Basic data analysis and ML libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`.

2. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
   Load CSV data, explore structure, identify missing values, and visualize key features.

3. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**
   - Handling missing data (e.g., Age, Embarked, Cabin)
   - Encoding categorical variables (Sex, Embarked)
   - Creating new features (e.g., FamilySize, IsAlone)

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Correlation heatmap
   - Survival rate comparisons by class, sex, age
   - Visualizations using `seaborn` & `matplotlib`

5. **Model Building**
   - Train/Test split
   - Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, SVM
   - Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, cross-validation

6. **Prediction**
   - Predict on test data (if available)
   - Export results for submission
   - 
## üìà Results
Accuracy measures how often the model correctly predicts whether a passenger survived or not. It is calculated as:
Accuracy = (Number of Correct Predictions) / (Total Predictions)
For example, if the model predicts correctly for 82 out of 100 passengers, the accuracy is 82%.

The notebook includes model evaluation and comparison. The best-performing model can be selected for final predictions based on accuracy or cross-validation scores.
